title: "Basic OSS Architecture"
---

The purpose of this project is to showcase the power of open source tools when designing a data and analytics system. I will be walking through my workflow step by step, and including both images, code, and notes.

## Project Initialization
First, I begin in my home directory. Then, I change to my Documents directory, which I use for all of my projects. This is where I'll begin creating the project directory and initializing the subsequent tools. As you'll see below, I first initialize the uv repository and change into it. Then, I create the repo on GitHub (because I like generating the license then), pull (my global is set to merge), commit, and make the initial push. Then, I will initialize the Quarto project, to begin documentation as I work.
